## Background

I come from a computer engineering background and recently graduated with a master's degree. I also had my bachelor's degree in computer engineering, and that's when I was first exposed to Machine Learning. The first course I took was extremely hard for me at that time, I struggled with homeworks consisting both theory and coding parts. I took several courses in ML and DL later during my study. I began learning DL using "https://zh-v2.d2l.ai/", a free online book with code examples written by 李沐. At that time, I could understand the lectures and complete assignments, but my knowledge felt fragmented and shallow. After I graduated this year and a question came up to me "What I want to do for my career as an engineer?". Traditional software engineers are typically devided into frontend and backend, but I feel like there is something I am more interested in rather than fitting myself in one of the catogories. I also hope myself could keep up with the evolving tech world.

I realized that *knowing the formulas* and *being able to implement a model* are two very
different things. It is a long way before I can use an efficient model to solve *real life problems* though I understand why we use a specific model for a *textbook example*.

## Why “seriously” this time?

By “seriously”, I mean learning machine learning in a **systematic and long-term way**, rather
than just passing exams or finishing isolated projects.

There are three main reasons.

---

## 1. ML/DL is no longer just an academic topic

Machine learning is no longer limited to research papers.
It is now widely used in real-world systems such as:

- recommendation systems  
- computer vision applications  
- natural language processing  
- decision-making and automation  

However, real-world ML work requires much more than theoretical knowledge.
It requires understanding data, debugging models, handling overfitting, and making
engineering trade-offs.

This made me realize that I needed to rebuild my ML foundation from the ground up.

## 2. I want to close the gap between “learning” and “working”

In many ML courses, the learning process looks like this:

- learn a model  
- write some code  
- get a result  
- move on  

But in real work, the process is very different:

- understand the problem  
- decide whether ML is even needed  
- choose an appropriate model  
- evaluate results critically  
- iterate and improve  

I started this blog to **document this transition** — from learning concepts to thinking like an
engineer.

## 3. Writing helps me think clearly

I’ve noticed that I often feel like I understand a topic, until I try to explain it. Even though I have taken several ML courses and exceled in some of them, it is still hard for me to explain to non-tech people what is ML. 

Writing forces me to answer questions like:

- Why does this model exist?
- What assumptions does it make?
- When should I *not* use it?
- What are the common pitfalls?

This blog is not meant to be a textbook.
It is a place where I explain things **in my own words**, after struggling with them.

## How I plan to learn ML and DL

My current learning plan focuses on four aspects:

1. **Classic machine learning**  
   Linear models, tree-based models, and their practical use cases.

2. **Deep learning fundamentals**  
   Neural networks, CNNs, and training techniques.

3. **Modern architectures**  
   Especially attention mechanisms and transformers.

4. **Projects and engineering practice**  
   End-to-end implementations with clear problem definitions.

I will update this blog as my understanding evolves.

## What to expect from this blog

In future posts, I plan to write about:

- intuitive explanations of ML models  
- implementation details using PyTorch or scikit-learn  
- mistakes I made and lessons I learned  
- small but complete projects  

If you are also learning machine learning, I hope these notes will be useful to you.

## Final thoughts

I don’t expect this journey to be easy.
But I believe that consistent, structured learning — combined with reflection — is the most
reliable way to build real expertise.

This blog is the first step.
